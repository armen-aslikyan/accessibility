Evaluate whether each frame title is RELEVANT and DESCRIPTIVE.\n\nFor each frame/iframe with a title, analyze:\n\n1. DESCRIPTIVE: Does the title describe the frame's content or purpose?\n   - Does it tell users what they'll find in the frame?\n   - Does it identify the source or type of content?\n   - Is it specific enough to distinguish from other frames?\n\n2. ACCURACY: Does the title match the actual frame content?\n   - For embedded videos: Does it identify it as a video and its topic?\n   - For maps: Does it describe what map/location is shown?\n   - For forms: Does it describe what the form is for?\n   - For widgets: Does it identify the widget's function?\n\n3. USEFULNESS: Would a screen reader user understand the frame's purpose?\n   - Can they decide whether to enter the frame or skip it?\n   - Does it provide enough context?\n\n4. CONCISENESS: Is the title appropriately brief but complete?\n   - Not too generic (\"content\", \"frame\", \"widget\")\n   - Not too long or verbose\n   - Focused on the essential information\n\nCommon issues to flag:\n- Generic titles: \"iframe\", \"frame\", \"content\", \"widget\"\n- Technical titles: \"ad-container\", \"tracking-pixel\", \"embed-123\"\n- Missing context: \"Video\" instead of \"Product demonstration video\"\n- Misleading titles that don't match content\n- Duplicate titles for different frames\n- URL or filename as title\n\nGood frame title examples:\n- \"Google Maps showing store location\"\n- \"YouTube video: How to use our product\"\n- \"Contact form\"\n- \"Live chat support widget\"\n- \"Payment processing form\"\n\nReport for each frame:\n- Frame element (src or context)\n- Current title attribute value\n- Assessment: PASS (relevant) or FAIL (not relevant)\n- If FAIL: Explanation and suggested improvement",
