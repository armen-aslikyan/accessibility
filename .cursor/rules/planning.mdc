# THE SPEC-FIRST RULE
- **Plan Mode First:** Before writing code, you MUST provide a "Step-by-Step Implementation Plan."
- **Verification:** For every step in your plan, state how you will verify it works (e.g., "I will run this test" or "I will check this log").
- **Question Everything:** If a request is ambiguous or would break an existing pattern, ask for clarification before editing.
