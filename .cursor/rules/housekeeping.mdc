# HOUSEKEEPING STANDARDS
- **Dead Code Removal:** If you replace a function or variable, delete the old one. Do not comment it out.
- **Import Hygiene:** Automatically remove unused imports in modified files.
- **No Production Logs:** Ensure `console.log` or debug print statements are removed before finalizing.
- **Dependency Check:** If you suggest a new library, check if a similar one is already in `package.json`.
