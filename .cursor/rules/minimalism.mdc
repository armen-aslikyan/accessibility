# PRECISE EXECUTION
- **Smallest Possible Change:** Aim for the minimal code diff. Do not refactor unrelated code.
- **No Style Changes:** Do not "fix" formatting or naming in unrelated lines unless explicitly asked.
- **Preserve Patterns:** Match the existing coding style of the file you are editing perfectly.
- **Search Before Create:** Always search the codebase for existing utilities/components before creating new ones.
