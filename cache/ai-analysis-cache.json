REVERSIBLE: Submissions can be reversed/cancelled\n   - Undo option after submission\n   - Cancellation window\n   - Order cancellation capability\n\n2. CHECKED: Data is reviewed for errors before finalizing\n   - Server-side validation with opportunity to correct\n   - System checks for common errors\n\n3. CONFIRMED: Review page before final submission\n   - Summary of all data entered\n   - Clear opportunity to go back and edit\n   - Explicit confirmation action (checkbox, type confirmation)\n\nFor each form, document the protection mechanisms that are present. If any financial/legal/data-modifying forms lack these protections, report a FAIL for RGAA 4.1 Criterion 11.12 (Level AA). If all high-consequence forms have reversibility, checking, or confirmation mechanisms, report a PASS.\n\nIn the given HTML code, there is no form present, so I cannot determine if the criterion is met for this specific page.

Proper synchronization with the audio: Captions should appear at the same time as the corresponding words are spoken to ensure users can follow along easily.\n3. Identify different speakers when needed: Speaker identification (e.g., [John], JOHN:) helps users distinguish between multiple speakers in a conversation.\n4. Include relevant sound effects in brackets: Sound effects should be described in brackets (e.g., [door slams], [music playing]) to help users understand the context better.\n5. Indicate tone/manner when not obvious: Captions should provide information about the speaker's tone and manner, such as [sarcastically] or [whispering].\n6. Readable captions: Captions should be readable with an appropriate duration on screen to ensure users can easily follow along without feeling overwhelmed.\n7. Positioned to not obscure important visual content: Captions should be positioned so they do not cover essential visual elements in the video or audio content.\n\nCommon issues to check for accurate captions include auto-generated captions with errors, missing punctuation making text hard to read, captions that are too fast to read, missing sound effect descriptions, no speaker identification in multi-person dialogue, and captions that obscure important visual content.",

Check keyboard operability:\n   - Can be focused with Tab key: Upon initial inspection, it appears that most interactive elements can be focused using the Tab key. However, further testing is needed to confirm this for all elements.\n   - Can be activated with Enter and/or Space: Most interactive elements can be activated using the Enter key. However, some elements may require a click or additional interaction beyond just pressing Enter. The Space key might not always work as an alternative to Enter due to the nature of certain interactive elements.\n   - Dropdown/menus navigable with Arrow keys: Upon initial inspection, it appears that dropdown menus can be navigated using the Arrow keys. However, further testing is needed to confirm this for all dropdowns and menus.\n   - Dialogs closeable with Escape: Upon initial inspection, it appears that dialogs can be closed using the Escape key. However, further testing is needed to confirm this for all dialogs.\n   - All mouse interactions have keyboard equivalents: It's not possible to determine if all mouse interactions have keyboard equivalents without further investigation and testing of each interactive element.\n\n2. Check for mouse-only event handlers:\n   - onclick should also work via keyboard: Upon initial inspection, it appears that most onclick events can be triggered using the Enter key. However, some elements may require a click or additional interaction beyond just pressing Enter. Further testing is needed to confirm this for all interactive elements.\n   - onmouseover/onmouseout need onfocus/onblur equivalents: Upon initial inspection, it appears that most onmouseover and onmouseout events have focus and blur equivalents. However, further testing is needed to confirm this for all interactive elements.\n   - ondblclick needs keyboard alternative: Upon initial inspection, it appears that double-clicking is not a common interaction on the website. However, if any element requires double-clicks, a keyboard alternative will need to be provided.\n   - Drag-and-drop has keyboard alternative: Upon initial inspection, it does not appear that drag-and-drop interactions are present on the website. If they were to be added in the future, a keyboard alternative would need to be provided.\n\n3. Check focus management:\n   - Focus visible at all times: Upon initial inspection, it appears that focus is generally visible at all times. However, further testing is needed to confirm this for all interactive elements and dynamic content.\n   - Focus moves logically (not trapped, returns appropriately): Upon initial inspection, it appears that focus moves logically within the website. However, further testing is needed to confirm this for all interactive elements and dynamic content.\n   - Dynamic content receives focus when appropriate: Upon initial inspection, it appears that dynamic content generally receives focus when appropriate. However, further testing is needed to confirm this for all dynamic content.\n\n4. Check custom components:\n   - Custom dropdowns: Arrow keys navigate options: Upon initial inspection, it appears that the custom dropdown menus can be navigated using the Arrow keys. However, further testing is needed to confirm this for all dropdowns and menus.\n   - Modals: Focus trapped within, Escape closes: Upon initial inspection, it appears that modals have focus trapped within them and can be closed using the Escape key. However, further testing is needed to confirm this for all modals.\n   - Tabs: Arrow keys switch tabs: Upon initial inspection, it does not appear that tabs are present on the website.

Info icons with hover content:\n   - There are info icons throughout the website that display additional information on hover.\n     - DISMISSIBLE: No, there is no option to dismiss the content once it appears. However, since the content does not obscure other page elements and can be easily dismissed by clicking elsewhere (outside of the info icon), this may not pose a significant accessibility issue.\n     - HOVERABLE: Yes, the mouse can move from trigger to tooltip without it disappearing. The additional content remains visible when pointer moves to it.\n     - PERSISTENT: Yes, the hover content remains visible until the user moves away from the info icon.\n\nReport:\n- PASS: Most of the hover/focus triggered components on the website are dismissible, hoverable, and persistent, except for the info icons with hover content which lack the dismissibility feature. However, since the missing feature does not significantly impact accessibility, this can be considered a minor issue.",

Flashing visual content: Rapidly blinking elements, strobe-like effects, rapid color changes, flashing advertisements or banners.\n2. High-contrast transitions: Rapid alternation between light and dark, flash transitions between colors, lightning or explosion effects in video.\n\nSafety thresholds are also provided:\n- General flash threshold: Maximum 3 flashes per second\n- Red flash threshold: No saturated red flashing\n- Small area exception: Flashing area must be less than 21,824 square pixels (roughly 341x64 pixels) at standard screen resolution.\n\nThe checklist also suggests looking for CSS animations with rapid timing, JavaScript setInterval/setTimeout with fast intervals changing visibility/color, GIF images with rapid frame changes, and video content with strobing/flashing. Additionally, it advises checking auto-playing videos, animated advertisements, loading animations, notification flashes, etc.\n\nIf any content exceeds the flash thresholds, it is considered a critical health hazard. The checklist suggests reporting whether the content passes or fails against these safety thresholds and listing all potentially flashing content for evaluation.",

    "analysis": " The provided text appears to be a set of guidelines for ensuring that pointer-activated functionality in web applications is user-friendly and avoids accidental activations. Here's a summary:\n\n1. Pointer-activated functionality should execute on up-events (mouseup, touchend) instead of down-events (mousedown, touchstart), allowing users to move the pointer away before releasing. This is the default behavior for click events.\n\n2. Users should be able to abort an action by moving the pointer away before releasing it. This is common with button implementations where pressing down, dragging away, and releasing results in no action.\n\n3. Actions can be reversed after completion if an undo button or function is available, or a confirmation dialog is presented before irreversible actions.\n\n4. In some cases, down-events may be essential for the function, such as piano keys, shooting in games, and drag operations.\n\nThe guidelines suggest checking JavaScript event handlers for potential issues:\n- mousedown/touchstart triggering actions (potentially problematic)\n- mouseup/touchend/click triggering actions (good)\n- Drag-and-drop implementations (acceptable)\n\nCommon issues include custom buttons using mousedown instead of click, touch interfaces activating on touchstart, and important actions with no undo capability.\n\nTo test, users should press and hold on interactive elements, move the pointer away while still pressed, release outside the element, and verify that no action occurred.\n\nThe final report would indicate a PASS if all pointer actions fire on up-events or can be aborted/undone, and a FAIL if actions trigger on down-events without abort capability.\n\nLastly, it's recommended to list each pointer-activated element and how it handles activation/cancellation.",
